Typescript runtime in C# (WIP and PoC trial)

## Why?

The simplicity of TS is a great asset and if one could have it as a scripting language as [lua](https://www.lua.org/home.html) or [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/), we could gain enourmous power. Obviously, if one can runtime a subset of TS, we might as well compile it :)
And... why not?

## How to publish?

### Mac OS

- dotnet publish -r osx-x64

- See more at [https://avaloniaui.net/docs/packing/macOS#manual](https://avaloniaui.net/docs/packing/macOS#manual) 

## How to run?

If you have only build the debug, use the following:
- ./bin/Debug/net5.0/osx-x64/TypeScriptNative

## How?

We use ANTLR as a compiler frontent to define syntax and rules (lexer and parser).
Machine code generation or runtime exectution is still in research phase

## Generate ANTLR code

1. `java -jar ../antlr-4.9.1-complete.jar -Dlanguage=CSharp ./TypeScriptLexer.g4 -visitor -o generated`
2. `java -jar ../antlr-4.9.1-complete.jar -Dlanguage=CSharp ./TypeScriptParser.g4 -visitor -o generated`

## LL code to EXEC

1. `llc code.ll` -> generates `code.s`
2. `gcc code.s -o code` -> generates `code` executable: run it by `./code`
